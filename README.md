# Projects Overview

This repository contains three projects:

1. **Caesar Cipher**
2. **Image Encryption and Decryption**
3. **Network Traffic Monitor**

## 1. Caesar Cipher

### Description
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project demonstrates how to implement and use the Caesar Cipher for basic encryption and decryption.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SubhamRakshit97/Cybersec_projects
   cd your-repo/caesar_cypher
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   This project requires Python 3.x.

## 2. Image Encryption and Decryption

### Description
This project implements image encryption and decryption using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. It allows you to encrypt an image file and then decrypt it back to its original form.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SubhamRakshit97/Cybersec_projects
cd your-repo/img_encrypt_decrypt
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install pillow cryptography
```
## 3. Network Traffic Monitor

### Description
The Network Traffic Monitor project captures and analyzes network traffic on a local network. It helps in monitoring network activities and identifying potential security issues.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SubhamRakshit97/Cybersec_projects
cd your-repo/network_traffic
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

This project requires Python 3.x and scapy library.
```bash
pip install scapy
sudo python3 main.py
```
It will ask for your system password.

## 4. Hashed Password Cracker

### Description
The Hashed Password Cracker is a cybersecurity project designed to demonstrate how hashed passwords can be cracked using various techniques. This project includes methods for cracking hashed passwords using brute-force and dictionary attacks. It supports multiple hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SubhamRakshit97/Cybersec_projects
cd hashed_password
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   This project requires Python 3.x. No additional dependencies are needed as it uses Python's standard library.
