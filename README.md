# Projects Overview

This repository contains three projects:

1. **Caesar Cipher**
2. **Image Encryption and Decryption**
3. **Network Traffic Monitor**

## 1. Caesar Cipher

### Description
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project demonstrates how to implement and use the Caesar Cipher for basic encryption and decryption.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo/caesar_cypher
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   This project requires Python 3.x.

## 2. Image Encryption and Decryption

### Description
This project implements image encryption and decryption using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. It allows you to encrypt an image file and then decrypt it back to its original form.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo/image_encryption_decryption
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install pillow cryptography
```
### 3. Network Traffic Monitor
Description
The Network Traffic Monitor project captures and analyzes network traffic on a local network. It helps in monitoring network activities and identifying potential security issues.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo/network_traffic_monitor
```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

This project requires Python 3.x and scapy library.
```bash
pip install scapy
```
